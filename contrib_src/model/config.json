    "abstract": "Biomedical imaging is a driver of scientific discovery and a core component of medical care and is being stimulated by the field of deep learning. While semantic segmentation algorithms enable image analysis and quantification in many applications, the design of respective specialized solutions is non-trivial and highly dependent on dataset properties and hardware conditions. We developed nnU-Net, a deep learning-based segmentation method that automatically configures itself, including preprocessing, network architecture, training and post-processing for any new task. The key design choices in this process are modeled as a set of fixed parameters, interdependent rules and empirical decisions. Without manual intervention, nnU-Net surpasses most existing approaches, including highly specialized solutions on 23 public datasets used in international biomedical segmentation competitions. We make nnU-Net publicly available as an out-of-the-box tool, rendering state-of-the-art segmentation accessible to a broad audience by requiring neither expert knowledge nor computing resources beyond standard network training.",

    "description": "This notebook provides a minimal working example of the thoracic organs at risk nnU-Net models, a series of tools for the segmentation of such anatomies from chest CT images. The model was trained using 60 thoracic CT scans, acquired with or without intravenous contrast. The dataset is composed of images with variable volume sizes, field of view, and slice thickness. We test the model by implementing an end-to-end (cloud-based) pipeline on publicly available chest CT scans hosted on the Imaging Data Commons (IDC), starting from raw DICOM CT data and ending with a DICOM SEG object storing the segmentation masks generated by the AI pipeline. The testing dataset we use is external and independent from the data used in the development phase of the model (training and validation) and is composed of a wide variety of image types (from image acquisition settings, to the presence of the contrast agent, to the presence, location and size of a tumor mass). The way all the operations are executed - from pulling data to data postprocessing and the standardisation of the results - have the goal of promoting transparency and reproducibility.",
