# Thoracic Organs at Risk Segmentation

This repositorty provides a minimal working example of the thoracic organs at risk nnU-Net models, a series of tools for the segmentation of such anatomies from chest CT images. The model was trained using 60 thoracic CT scans, acquired with or without intravenous contrast. The dataset is composed of images with variable volume sizes, field of view, and slice thickness.

We test the model by implementing an end-to-end (cloud-based) pipeline on publicly available chest CT scans hosted on the Imaging Data Commons (IDC), starting from raw DICOM CT data and ending with a DICOM SEG object storing the segmentation masks generated by the AI pipeline. The testing dataset we use is external and independent from the data used in the development phase of the model (training and validation) and is composed of a wide variety of image types (from image acquisition settings, to the presence of the contrast agent, to the presence, location and size of a tumor mass).

The way all the operations are executed - from pulling data to data postprocessing and the standardisation of the results - have the goal of promoting transparency and reproducibility.
